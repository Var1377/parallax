# Cambridge Computer Science Dissertation: Writing Style Guide

This guide outlines key principles for writing a Cambridge Computer Science undergraduate dissertation, specifically considering the limited time examiners have (approximately 20 minutes) to assess a substantial document (up to 12,000 words / 40 pages). The goal is to ensure clarity, impact, and efficient communication of your work.

## Core Principles

1.  **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   **Direct Language:** Use precise, unambiguous language. Avoid overly complex sentence structures.
    *   **Brevity:** Get straight to the point. Eliminate unnecessary words, phrases, or sections. Every sentence should contribute.
    *   **Define Jargon:** If technical terms specific to your project are necessary, define them clearly upon first use. Assume a knowledgeable CS audience, but not necessarily an expert in *your specific sub-field*.

2.  **Focus on Rationale over Implementation Detail (Especially in Main Body):**
    *   **Explain the *Why*:** Prioritize explaining the strategic reasons *why* certain design choices, algorithms, or techniques were used. What problem were they solving? What were the alternatives considered? What are the trade-offs?
    *   **Avoid Deep Dives in Main Text:** While implementation details are important, reserve deep dives into specific file structures, function names, or minor code-level decisions for appendices or illustrative examples *if necessary*. The main chapters, particularly Implementation, should focus on the *architecture, core algorithms, and design philosophy*.
    *   **Target Audience:** Remember the examiner needs to grasp the *concepts* and *contributions* quickly. Overly detailed implementation descriptions can obscure the bigger picture.

3.  **Structure for Skimmability:**
    *   **Clear Introduction:** State the motivation, research questions/goals, contributions, and a roadmap of the dissertation. Make it easy for the examiner to understand *what* you did, *why* it's important, and *where* to find the details.
    *   **Logical Flow:** Ensure chapters and sections follow a logical progression. Use informative headings and subheadings to guide the reader.
    *   **Signposting:** Use phrases that indicate the structure and direction of the argument (e.g., "This chapter discusses...", "Having established X, we now turn to Y...", "In summary...").

4.  **Highlight Key Information:**
    *   **Emphasize Contributions:** Clearly state your novel contributions and key findings. Don't bury them in dense paragraphs. Consider using bullet points or bold text for emphasis in the introduction and conclusion.
    *   **Effective Summaries:** Include brief summaries at the end of complex sections or chapters to reinforce the main points.
    *   **Focused Conclusion:** Reiterate the main findings, contributions, and their significance. Briefly discuss limitations and future work. This is the final impression you leave.

5.  **Visual Aids:**
    *   **Purposeful Figures/Tables:** Use diagrams, graphs, and tables to present data, algorithms, or system architectures visually and efficiently.
    *   **Self-Contained:** Ensure figures and tables are understandable on their own, with clear captions and labels.
    *   **Reference Clearly:** Refer to all figures and tables explicitly in the text (e.g., "as shown in Figure 3.1...", "Table 4.2 summarises...").

6.  **Professional Presentation:**
    *   **Formal Tone:** Maintain a formal, objective academic tone.
    *   **Proofreading:** Thoroughly proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Errors distract and undermine credibility.
    *   **Consistent Formatting:** Adhere strictly to the specified formatting guidelines (font size, margins, referencing style). Consistency aids readability.

## Avoiding an Overly Automated Tone

While clarity and formality are key, the writing should still sound like it was written by a human author engaged with the material. To avoid sounding too generic or AI-generated:

1.  **Vary Sentence Structure:** Mix short, impactful sentences with longer, more complex ones. Avoid starting consecutive sentences with the same phrase (e.g., "Additionally...", "Furthermore...").
2.  **Use Active Voice Predominantly:** While passive voice has its place (e.g., describing standard procedures), active voice generally makes the writing more direct and engaging (e.g., "We implemented X" vs. "X was implemented").
3.  **Incorporate (Appropriate) Personal Reflection:** In sections like the Introduction (motivation), Implementation (challenges encountered), Evaluation (limitations), and Conclusions (lessons learned), use the first person ("I" or "we") naturally to describe decisions, challenges, and insights. Avoid overdoing it, but completely omitting the author's voice can feel sterile.
4.  **Choose Precise Verbs:** Opt for strong, specific verbs instead of vague ones (e.g., "demonstrates" or "reveals" instead of "shows"; "implements" or "constructs" instead of "makes").
5.  **Avoid Overused Buzzwords and Jargon:** While technical accuracy is crucial, avoid stuffing the text with unnecessary jargon or trending buzzwords just for the sake of it. Ensure every technical term serves a clear purpose.
6.  **Ensure Natural Transitions:** Connect ideas smoothly between paragraphs and sections. Use transition words and phrases thoughtfully, ensuring they reflect the logical relationship accurately (e.g., "however," "consequently," "in contrast," "specifically").
7.  **Read Aloud:** Reading sections of your writing aloud is an excellent way to catch awkward phrasing, repetitive structures, or sentences that don't flow naturally.
8.  **Inject Specificity:** Replace generic statements with concrete details and examples from your project whenever possible. Specificity makes the writing more credible and engaging.
9.  **Use Bullet Points Sparingly:** While bullet points can be effective for highlighting distinct items (like requirements or contributions in a summary), overuse can fragment the text and disrupt the narrative flow. Prefer well-structured paragraphs for explaining related concepts or processes unless the list format significantly enhances clarity and skimmability for that specific content.

## Adhere to the Standard Structure

The Cambridge CS dissertation has a specific required structure that examiners expect. Following this structure is crucial for navigation and assessment. Ensure your dissertation includes the following sections in this order:

1.  **Cover Page**
2.  **Declaration of Originality**
3.  **Proforma**
4.  **Table of Contents**
5.  **Chapter 1: Introduction** (Outline motivation, background, related work, goals, approach, structure)
6.  **Chapter 2: Preparation** (Outline requirements, design decisions, technologies, starting point)
7.  **Chapter 3: Implementation** (Detail compiler, runtime, interaction nets, challenges)
8.  **Chapter 4: Evaluation** (Present methodology, performance results, memory usage, usability, limitations)
9.  **Chapter 5: Conclusions** (Summarise achievements, future work, lessons learned)
10. **Bibliography**
11. **Appendices** (Include supplementary material like code samples, detailed benchmark results, user guides, if applicable)
12. **Index** (If required/useful)
13. **Project Proposal** (Attach the original proposal)

Sticking to this format helps the examiner quickly locate specific information.

## Examiner's Perspective

Remember, the examiner needs to quickly:
*   Understand the problem you addressed.
*   Grasp your approach and methodology.
*   Identify your key contributions and results.
*   Assess the significance and quality of the work.

Structure your writing to make this process as easy as possible. Prioritise clarity and make your main points stand out.
